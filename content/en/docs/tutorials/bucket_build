Pirate Ship (bucket) Construction Guide
=======================================

The aim of this tutorial is to enable you to make your own bucket, similar to those that will be used at the competition.

Materials
---------

* 4 B&Q single wheel swivel [castors](http://www.diy.com/nav/fix/hardware/ironmongery/castors/B-and-Q-Castor-Single-Wheel-Swivel-9370702), part number 3209745.
* A 395mm by 255mm piece of 6mm MDF.
* A 1m long 15mm diameter pine rod
* A 210mm piece of TODO: DIMENSIONS pine.
* A [9l Really Useful Box](http://www.reallyusefulproducts.co.uk/uk/html/onlineshop/rub/b09_0litre.php) (RUB).
* Printed [markers](/docs/programming/sr/vision/markers) for the ends and sides of the box.

It should be fine to use other materials for the wooden parts of the bucket,
 but the ones at the competition will be made using wooden components.

<div class="info" markdown="1">
Note that the markers for the sides and ends of the box need to be paired correctly,
 as detailed in the [rules](/docs/rules).
As a reminder &mdash; the lowest numbered side goes with the lowest numbered end, and so on.
</div>

Some general tips when making things:

* Be absolutely certain that your measurements are correct before cutting anything.
  The rule is "measure twice, cut once".
* If you're unsusre about how to cut something, prototype it by testing on a scrap piece.

Prepare the base
----------------

The castors should be mounted on the MDF sheet,
 inset from the corners by TODO DISTANCE,
 as shown in the diagram below:

TODO: make a better diagram in iknscape/whatever once we have the actual dimensions
TODO: what size are the holes in the castors?
TODO: what size/length bolts/screws do they want to use?

Attach the base
---------------

The MDF sheet should be attached to the (outside) bottom of the RUB,
 TODO: how? using bolts? What size/length?


Prepare the inside
------------------

Drill a 15mm hole (TODO: all the way through?) in the pine block.
TODO: which way? or is it square?

Check that the hole you've drilled allows the pine rod to sit in it.
TODO: is this just a tight fit, or is it held in place by glue/bolts?

Attach the inside
-----------------

The pine block should be placed in the middle of the RUB, acrross the width.
It should just fill the width, and its edges should be (TODO: (335 - pine width) / 2 == ?)mm from the ends.

Be sure to place it in with the hole that you drilled oriented vertically,
 and then bolt (TODO what size/length?) it in place.
TODO: is this through the MDF too, or is the base of the RUB enough to hold it?
TODO: if the latter, then the inside needs to be done before the bottom!


Final Steps
-----------

Attach the markers you've printed to the ends and sides of the bucket.
Take care that you don't crumple the markers,
 and that you don't cover the borders of the markers when attaching them.

Put the pine rod into the hole drilled for it and admire your new Pirate Ship!
