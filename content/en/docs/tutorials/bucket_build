Pirate Ship (bucket) Construction Guide
=======================================

The aim of this tutorial is to enable you to make your own bucket, similar to those that will be used at the competition.

Materials
---------

* 4 B&Q single wheel swivel [castors](http://www.diy.com/nav/fix/hardware/ironmongery/castors/B-and-Q-Castor-Single-Wheel-Swivel-9370702), part number 3209745.
* A 395mm by 255mm piece of 6mm MDF.
* A 1m long 15mm diameter pine rod
* A 210mm piece of pine.
* A [9l Really Useful Box](http://www.reallyusefulproducts.co.uk/uk/html/onlineshop/rub/b09_0litre.php) (RUB).
* Printed [markers](/docs/programming/sr/vision/markers) for the ends and sides of the box.

It should be fine to use other materials for the wooden parts of the bucket,
 but the ones at the competition will be made using wooden components.

Note that the markers for the sides and ends of the box need to be paired correctly,
 as detailed in the [rules](/docs/rules).
As a reminder &mdash; the lowest numbered side goes with the lowest numbered end, and so on.

Some general tips when making things:

* Be absolutely certain that your measurements are correct before cutting anything.
  The rule is "measure twice, cut once".
* If you're unsure about how to cut something, prototype it by testing on a scrap piece.


Preparing the Pine Block
------------------------

Drill a 15mm diameter hole halfway through the pine block.
This should be large enough to fit the pine rod inside.
If it is loose it can be glued in place later.

Preparing the RUB and MDF Base
-------------------------------

The RUB should have holes drilled in the bottom to accomodate
 the bolts to hold the casters in place and for screws to affix the MDF
 base to the RUB and the pine block.
 
This image shows the positioning of the casters and screws.

Attaching the base and inside block
-----------------------------------

The Pine block should be placed in the middle the RUB, across the width 
 with the hole for the rod facing upwards.
 It should just fill the width with a small gap either side of the box.

The MDF sheet should then be attached through the bottom of the RUB into
 the block of pine with 5 screws, this should firmly join the RUB, pine
 block and MDF bottom together.

Attaching the Casters
---------------------

The 4 casters need to be attached to the MDF, through the RUB with bolts.
This will also secure the MDF bottom to the pirate ship.

Final Steps
-----------

Attach the markers you've printed to the ends and sides of the bucket.
Take care that you don't crumple the markers,
 and that you don't cover the borders of the markers when attaching them.
Put the pine rod into the hole drilled for it and admire your new Pirate Ship!
