A Robot Building Walkthrough
============================

The aim of this walkthrough is to take you through &mdash; step-by-step &mdash; the process of writing code and running it on the kit. We'll start off with a [_hello world_ program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program), the first program most programmers write in every language. As Student Robotics involves a lot of electronics, we'll use a slightly adapted _hello world_ program which flashes an LED on the [power board](docs/kit/power_board) instead.

Once that's up and running, we'll continue to advance what the examples do up to a point where the vision software is used. You should, in theory, be able to do anything then (well, if you read the other documentation, anyway!).

Hello World!
------------

The aim for our _hello world_ program is to flash an LED. We'll turn it on for 1 second, then turn it off for 1 second, then on... ad infinitum. This should take you through all you need to do to write a basic program for you robot (kit).

Here goes...
