Getting Code on the Robot
=========================

<div class="warning">This documentation is currently out-of-date, and is in the process of being rewritten.  It should be completed within the next week or so.</div>

<div class="info">
It is possible to plug the memory stick into your robot after it has been turned on.
You can also pull the stick out of your robot while it's powered up, change the code and plug it back in.
The new code should load and will run when you press the button.
</div>

To get the code onto your robot, you'll need to use the provided memory stick.
The code is transferred from the IDE to the memory stick, and then the memory stick is plugged into the robot's USB hub.
You can follow these steps when you've got some code you'd like to run:

1. On the _Projects_ tab, click _Export Project_ (this will check your code, then offer a file for download)
2. Save the file (_robot.zip_) to the root folder of the memory stick (as in `F:\` or `H:\` or whatever the drive letter is for you)
3. _Safely remove_ the memory stick
4. Plug it into your robot's USB hub

Now you can turn on your robot (or kit) and press the _run_ button.

<div class="info">
You can also export the current project at any point using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+E.
