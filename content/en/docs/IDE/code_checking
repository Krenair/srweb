Code Checking
=============

Your code is checked automatically everytime you click _Export Project_ in the _Projects_ tab.
If you wish to check code before you export it, you can do so by clicking the _Check Code_ button also on the _Projects_ tab.
If there are any errors with your code, the code checker will present a warning offering you the chance to view the errors.
