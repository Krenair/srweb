The IDE
=======

The IDE (or Integrated Development Environment) has been written especially for Student Robotics. It is a web-based IDE which means all work needs to be done with an internet connection. This is a good thing, though: all of your code will be on our server so you don't need to worry about losing your memory stick. (But please don't lose it!)

To get to the IDE, the is a link in the menu above. You can also click [here](https://www.studentrobotics.org/ide/).
