Power Board
===========

The Power Board is the central piece of the electronics kit.
It runs the code that you write in the SR IDE and controls all of the other boards in the kit.
Your kit includes a single Power Board which is connected into the [Token Ring](docs/kit/token_ring), it also has a USB hub connected to it which allows both the webcam and the USB memory stick to be plugged in.
To ensure that your robot is safe before your code starts running and if there are any problems the power board only gives power to the motors and any electronics you develop when your python code is running.

Indicators
----------

|   LED           | Meaning                        | Inital power-up state
|-----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------
| 3.3V            | The board is powered           | On
| 5V              | The BealgeBoard is powered     | On
| Charging        | The battery is charging*       | Off
| Motor Rail      | The Motor Rail is powered      | Off
| Token           | The token-ring is functioning  | On
| SRIC Activity   | Data is being transferred      | Off
| Blown Fuse      | The main fuse has blown or is missing | Off
| User            | Controllable from user code    | Off

*Unfortunately due to the design of the electronics the charging LED will only light up when the battery is charging and the Power Board is switched on.
If the Power Board is switched off then the charging LED will not light but the battery will charge and the LEDs/dial on the charger should show this.
