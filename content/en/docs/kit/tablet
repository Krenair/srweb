Connecting to the robot
-----------------------

First you should make sure the tablet is connected to your robot's WiFi. This
should happen automatically, but if there is a problem you can manually connect
to the robot using the information provided.

Open the "Student Robotics" app when you are connected to the robot's WiFi and
that will open the browser to `http://robot.sr/` and display the tablet
interface for your robot.
