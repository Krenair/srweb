JointIO Board
===========

The JointIO Board allows you to connect the SR kit to your own electronics. It has 8 inputs which can be configured to read either digital or analogue values and 8 digital outputs capable of driving small loads.
The board also provides 3.3V to power some/all of your electronics. Both the inputs and outputs of the board use 3.3V logic so you should keep this in mind when interfaceing with the board.
