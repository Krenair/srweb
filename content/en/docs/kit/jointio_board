JointIO Board
===========

The JointIO Board allows you to connect the SR kit to your own electronics. It has 8 inputs which can be configured to read either digital or analogue values and 8 digital outputs capable of driving small loads.
The board also provides 3.3V to power some/all of your electronics. Both the inputs and outputs of the board use 3.3V logic so you should keep this in mind when interfaceing with the board.

|  Parameter                               |   Value   |
|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Power Output Voltage                     | 3.3V      |
| Maximum Total Output Current[^1]         | 1A        |
| Maximum Current Per Output               | 100mA     |
| Output High Voltage                      | 3.3V      |
| Output Low Voltage                       | 0V        |
| Maximum Input Voltage                    | 12V       |
| Maximum Measurable Input Voltage         | 3.3V      |
| Input Digital Threshold Voltage          | 1.65V     |

[^1]: The output current available from the power output connection depends on how much current is being drawn from the outputs. The total current drawn from all outputs and the power output must not exceed this value.
