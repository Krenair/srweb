HobbyKing HKE4 Chargers
=======================

![hobby king e4 charger](/images/content/kit/battery_charger_HKE4.png "A HobbyKing E4 battery charger")

Some kits will contain a black HobbyKing HKE4 charger. This charger is simpler and easier to use than the iMAX B6 charger, while retaining all of the functionality required for charging the batteries supplied with the kit. The charging cable is cable-tied to the charger and you must not remove this cable. The charging lead is terminated with 4mm bullet connectors, which present a very high risk of shorting the battery if removed from the charger.

This list must be followed carefully each time a battery is connected to the charger.

1.   Turn the current adjuster knob to the 12 o'clock position (2 amps).

1.   Unplug the charger from the mains.

1.   Unplug the monitoring lead from the battery to the charger.
