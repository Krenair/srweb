Motor Board
===========

<img src="/images/content/kit/motor_board.png" alt="A photo of an un-cased motor board" title="An un-cased motor board" class="right" />
The Motor Board can be used to control a single 12V DC motor. Your kit contains two of these boards to allow you control motors for moving your robot although don't feel you are limited to using them for this purpose.

Indicators
----------

|   LED           | Meaning                | Inital power-up state
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------
| Power           | The board is powered   | On
| SRIC Activity   | The board is transferring data | Off
| Token           | The token-ring is functioning | On
| Motor Power     | The motor has power and will turn when instructed to | Off
| Current Limit   | Too much current is being drawn from the output | Off
| Feedback        | Undefined              | Off
| Motor           | Brightness shows power, LED shows direction | Off

After you have started your code the `Motor power LED` should come on and the `Current Limit LED` remain off.

Case Dimensions

All dimensions are in mm.

Specification
-------------

|  Parameter                           |   Value   |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| Absolute Maximum Input Voltage       | 16V       |
| Output Voltage                       | 12V       |
| Maximum Output Current               | 5A        |
| Output Current Limit*                | 5.5A      |
| PWM Frequency                        | 324Hz     |
| PWM Duty Cycle Range                 | 0-99%     |
| PWM Duty Cycle Steps (per direction) | 100       |

*It is strongly advised to operate well within the current limit of the motor board or strange behaviour may be observed.
