Motor Board
===========

<img src="/images/content/kit/motor_board.png" alt="A photo of an un-cased motor board" title="An un-cased motor board" class="right" />
The Motor Board can be used to control a single 12V DC motor. Your kit contains two of these boards to allow you control motors for moving your robot although don't feel you are limited to using them for this purpose.

Indicators
----------

|   LED           | Meaning                | Inital power-up state
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------
| Power           | The board is powered   | On
| SRIC Activity   | The board is transferring data | Off
| Token           | The token-ring is functioning | On
| Motor Power     | The motor has power and will turn when instructed to | Off
| Current Limit   | Unused                 | Off
| Feedback        | Undefined              | Off
| Motor           | Brightness shows power, LED shows direction | Off

After you have started your code the `Motor power LED` should come on.

Case Dimensions
---------------

All dimensions are in mm. Don't forget that the CAT5 cables stick out slightly.

Specification
-------------

|  Parameter                           |   Value   |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| Absolute Maximum Input Voltage       | 16V       |
| Output Voltage                       | 12V       |
| Maximum Output Current               | 5A        |
| PWM Frequency                        | 324Hz     |
| PWM Duty Cycle Range                 | 0-99%     |
| PWM Duty Cycle Steps (per direction) | 100       |

Unlike last year, the motor board does not have any current limiting.
This means that there should be fewer problems with motors not operating correctly however care must be taken that the output is not over-loaded or shorted.
If the output of a motor board is shorted then the main power fuse on the power board will blow.

You can access the schematics and source code of the firmware on the motor board in the following places.
You do not need this information to use the board but it may be of interest to some people.
