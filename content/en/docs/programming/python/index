Python
======

Student Robotics robots are all programmed in [Python](http://www.python.org); to program a robot, it is important that you have a basic understanding of Python.

There are a number of tutorials out there which would help you to learn program:

* [The Official Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/) -- the good stuff starts at chapter 3, but you should at least skim the stuff before it; there is a lot there and it may be a little overwhelming.

* A number of tutorials for beginners are linked to from [here](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers). [Byte of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python_en:Functions) seems like a good one.

* A number of tutorials for people that have programmed before are linked to from [here](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers). [Dive Into Python](http://diveintopython.org/toc/index.html) is a good book for people that have programmed before, but it is a fairly long read.

Some of the more advanced python features &mdash; [yield](docs/programming/python/yield), for example &mdash; are explained by us here. They will be parts of python that are quite advanced, but where only a little understanding is required to use them.
