SR2012 Competition nearly here!
===============================

There is just over a week to go before the SR2012 Competition!

The competition will be taking place in [Building 40](http://data.southampton.ac.uk/building/40.html),
 Highfield Campus, University of Southampton and is a two day event
 starting on Saturday 14th April at 9:30 AM.

Both days are compulsory as matches will start towards the end of the
 first day, with time to work on your robot in the morning.

In addition, all team members must bring along their [ticket](/schools/team-leaders/#Tickets),
 obtainable once a [Media Consent Form](/resources/2012/mediaconsent.pdf)
 has been received by Student Robotics.

More details can be found on the [SR2012 Competition Page](/events/sr2012/2012-04-14-competition).

We look forward to seeing you all there, good luck with the competition
 and may the best robot win!
