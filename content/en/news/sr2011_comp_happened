The Competition Happened. It Was Awesome!
=========================================

<img src="TODO" alt="competition" class="left" />

The annual Student Robotics competition happened a couple of weeks back,
 and we think everyone had a great day!

Fifteen teams from thirteen schools across five counties and two countries came together to pit their robotic creations in a titanic battle of wits.
A gruelling 32 match league stage provided seeding for the later knock-out stage that would determine the winners of Student Robotics 2011.
Congratulations to all the competitors, whatever place achieved,
 we hope that you've all had fun & learnt something along the way.
