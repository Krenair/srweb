From Robot to Robot - Student Robotics at 27C3
==============================================

Rob Spanton, one of the founding members of Student Robotics, was invited to give [a talk about SR](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/events/4175.en.html) at [27C3](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/wiki/Welcome). In the talk, Rob talks about the motivation behind SR, what SR is currently doing and is planning to do, and gives a technical overview of the hardware and software we provide.

You can find the official video of the that talk [here](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2010/27c3-4175-en-from_robot_to_robot.html), and his slides are [here](http://xgoat.com/wp/wp-content/2010/12/robot-to-robot.pdf).

27C3 was the 27th Chaos Communication Congress, held in Berlin from December 27 to December 30, and is one of the largest international hacker meetings.
