SR2012 KickStart, this Saturday!
===================================

The annual Student Robotics KickStart is coming up this Saturday!  It is with this event that SR2012 begins.  Teams from around the country will be attending to meet other competitors, discover this year's game, and learn about the challenges ahead of them.

Information for registered teams:
---------------------------------

KickStart will be happening on Saturday the 24th of September &mdash; please aim to arrive at **10:00**. The day will finish at around **16:30**, and we will be handing out kit then. This will include 2m aluminium L-sections, so please be sure you can transport them.

We'll be starting in **Building 32** on the University of Southampton's Highfield Campus, please see [the campus map](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/visitus/campuses/maps/highfield_3d_key.pdf "University of Southampton, Highfield Campus map") and [this street map, showing the location of the campus](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Southampton+SO17+1BJ&hl=en&ll=50.936039,-1.39595&spn=0.010047,0.014012&sll=50.930386,-1.393204&sspn=0.020097,0.028024&z=16 "Google Maps for SO17 1BJ").

We'll be putting out signs indicating places to park on campus.

A [provisional schedule](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.robotics.srobo.general/293 "KickStart schedule") is available from our mailing list.

Unfortunately, we cannot provide food &mdash; we recommend either bringing your own lunch or visiting one of the shops around and about the campus.

We very much hope to see you there!
