...the people who make the dream of Student Robotics a Reality
--------------------------------------------------------------

Student Robotics depends entirely on the generous donations from Southampton
University, ECS & Engineering companies. The following companies were heavily
involved in the 2009-10 competition sponsorship.

### Motorola Foundation ###

The Motorola Foundation is the primary sponsor of Student Robotics. They have
provided most of the money needed to make it all happen.
	


### University of Southampton's School of Electronics and Computer Science ###

<abbr title="School of Electronics and Computer Science">ECS</abbr> not
only provide us a place to meet and work, they have helped in other areas
including a lot of the design of this website. ECS also employs two interns to work on behalf of Student Robotics, allowing us to develop our new website and kit ready for 2011.


### Southampton University Community Volunteering ###

All of the mentors that are in contact with students from schools and
colleges are required to have a <abbr title="Criminal Record Bureau">
CRB</abbr> check done. Doing so costs. But, thanks to Southampton
University Community Volunteering, we were able to get the checks done with
no cost to us, or to individual mentors. This has been a great help.

### BitBox ###

Back for 2011, BitBox have helped us manufacture several parts of the Student Robotics kit in previous years.
