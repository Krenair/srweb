Getting Involved
================

Schools and Colleges
--------------------

We would love it if more schools (with sixth-forms) and colleges got involved. The [competition]() gets better and better each year, and can only get better with more teams! Head over to the [Schools]() section to find out more. 


Southampton University Students
-------------------------------

We are always looking for university students to help. Anyone from Engineers to Graphic designers are welcome to join us and help with everything from hardware design through to media. If you are a Southampton University student and are interested or want to find out more, please [contact us]() or come along to our weekly (term time) society meetings.


Sponsors
--------

Student Robotics really could not happen if we didn't have our sponsors. And there are more ways to sponsor than giving money: you could offer bits of kit, your services (manufacturing, printing, etc...), or perhaps even your time. Visit the [Sponsors]() page to find out more.
