KickStart
=========

Shortly after the start of the academic year (around mid September in the UK)
 we hold a central event that all the teams are invited to called "KickStart".
This is the beginning of the journey for the teams,
 and it is where the game that their robots will have to compete in is revealed.

KickStart provides an opportunity for the teams get to meet their competitors,
 and take part in a mini-game that gets them thinking about the types of challenges they will face over the coming months.
They are also given talks about a number of skills key to Student Robotics
 which they may not already have.
The topics of these talks have included Mechanical assembly, Prototyping, Electronics, Coding and Project Management.

#### Mini-Game ####

The mini-game offers the teams an insight into the time pressures throughout the coming months that will distract them from building their robot.
In general they are given a very simple task to complete,
 usually something similar to the challenge of the main competition,
 and can be achieved with simple craft materials (card, balloons, elastic bands, sticking tape etc.).
In the past the challenge has been to make a self-propelled vehicle travel the furthest distance,
 or launching a small plastic ball the furthest.

The mini-game typically lasts around an hour and a half,
 though this time is filled with interruptions taken from the coming academic and calendar years.
For example, around 30 minutes into the challenge, everyone must stop work first for Christmas
 (complete with mince pies) and then for a short quiz that represents the January exams.
