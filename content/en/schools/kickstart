KickStart

Shortly after the start of the academic year (around mid September in the UK)
 we hold a central event that all the teams are invited to called "KickStart".
This is the beginning of the journey for the teams,
 and it is where the game that their robots will have to compete in is revealed.

KickStart provides an opportunity for the teams get to meet their competitors,
 and take part in a mini-game that gets them thinking about the types of challenges they will face over the coming months.
They are also given talks about a number of skills key to Student Robotics
 which they may not already have.
The topics of these talks have included Mechanical assembly, Prototyping, Electronics, Coding and Project Management.
