The Kit
=======

This year's kit is currently under development and some fairly large changes are
happening:

At the heart of last year's kit was what we affectionately refereed to as
_The Slug_: a now&ndash;discontinued, heavily&ndash;modified
<abbr title="Network Attached Storage">NAS</abbr> device from Linksys. This
system, although successful, was not very maintainable.

This year, we've made the leap to [Beagleboards](http://beagleboard.org/) which
should dramatically improve the situation: faster code running on the
robots, faster robot boot times, and we'll even attach a 480x272
multi&ndash;purpose colour display! As well as this, the rest of the
kit (motor boards, PWM boards and JointIO boards) is being redesigned
to be even better and much more difficult to break!




_When more information about the kit is available, it will appear here._
