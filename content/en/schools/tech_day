Tech Days
=========

Throughout the year we run intensive sessions knowns as "Tech Day"s that allow the local teams to get further help from mentors.

These all-day events are held at each of the SR Branches,
 with all the local teams, their robots and mentors in attendance.
This allows the teams to make great progress on their robots,
 and to work out any problems they may have been having in the presence of a much greater concentration of mentors and experience.

Tech Days also allow the teams to once again meet their competitor teams,
 show off their robot to everyone and to exchange ideas with other teams face-to-face.
