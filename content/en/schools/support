Mentoring
=========

We aim to provide a regular mentoring service for schools that are close enough to one of our branches.
The mentors are usually university students,
 and will provide support and guidance to the teams they mentor,
 aiming to provide both knowledge of the SR [kit](/docs/kit) and of building robots for SR competitions in general.
They also monitor the team's progress,
 and are the teams' primary point of contact with SR.

Tech Days
=========

Throughout the year we run intensive sessions knowns as "Tech Day"s that allow the local teams to get further help from mentors.

These all-day events are held at each of the SR Branches,
 with all the local teams,
 their robots and mentors in attendance.
This allows the teams to make great progress on their robots,
 and to work out any problems they may have been having in the presence of a much greater concentration of mentors and experience.

Teams also tend to get a large proportion of their robot built or working on these days.
As they get a full day working on it,
 while during school times they may only get one hour a week for example.

Tech Days also allow the teams to once again meet their competitor teams,
 show off their robot to everyone and to exchange ideas with other teams face-to-face.

In the past there has also been a testing area present at the Tech Days,
 which allows teams to test out how their robots behave in an arena made of the same materials as the one at the competition.
For example, some teams have traction issues on their wheels,
 here it can be tested thoroughly and any bugs their code may have cn be worked out.

Forums
======

Student Robotics hosts private forums where all the teams
 (including the teachers)
 and mentors can ask questions and get answers.
We have found that this is a remarkably productive way of solving problems with the robots,
 and we encourage all participants to answer each others questions.
Near the beginning of the competition,
 students and teachers are given their login details which allow access to both the forums and the IDE.

Documentation
==============

As far as is possible,
 all the [kit](/docs/kit) that we provide to schools is open-source and fully documented online.
The documentation is made available online for all the competitors,
 and includes both detailed schematics of the hardware,
 as well as walkthroughts for setting up their robots.
There is also a guide to [programming](/docs/programming) in [Python](http://python.org),
 the programming language used for students to program their robots,
 and examples on what their code should look like.

The IDE
=======

We provide a web-based Integrated Development Environment
 ([IDE](/docs/IDE))
 where the teams can develop the software for their robots.
The online nature of the IDE avoids the need for the students to install
 any software on either their own or their schools computers,
 greatly accelerating the start of their programming.
It also ensures that the teams code is always available to them,
 as they can connect from anywhere with an internet connection,
 and don't need to worry about whether they have the latest version with them.
The central IDE also allows us to push updates to the SR software running on the robots to fix bugs or to add features.
