Welcome to Student Robotics
===========================

Student Robotics is an exciting competition between sixth form schools and colleges in the Southampton area to build fully autonomous robots. Led by a group of students from the University of Southampton, the teams in the competition will have to design, build and test their robots ready to compete against other local teams.

How did Student Robotics begin?
-------------------------------

The idea for Student Robotics arose from the experiences of Howard, Justyn, Jeffrey and Robert from when they took a team of sixth form students from Peter Symonds College to the FIRST competition in North America. The FIRST competition is a tremendous event involving thousands of teams, most of whom are from the USA and Canada. The students who were involved in the competition had an amazing time, but the cost to enter the competition including travel was almost prohibitive.

Who is involved?
----------------

Student Robotics is a group of University of Southampton students. This group is engineering led but encompasses students who are studying computer science, chemistry and even art and design.

What hardware do we use?
------------------------

Student Robotics design, build and develop all of the electronics themselves. As well as providing an additional challenge for the team (often welcomed, often not!), it means the competing sixth forms and colleges have custom hardware tailored to their precise need.

Over the last two years the team have managed to produce an electronics kit that provides lots of functionality but with the flexibility for students to experiment/develop their own solutions. The kit has an easy to use modular design. All of the hardware will be continually developed over the years, providing the best possible resources for competing teams.

What support do the students get?
---------------------------------

Students benefit from weekly visits by Student Robotics volunteers. This is their chance to ask questions, do the majority of the building/designing and a chance for us to asses progress. The helpers are there from the start; beginning with the design and prototyping, and ending on the afternoon of the competition.

How are we funded?
------------------

Sponsorship. Student Robotics depends entirely on the generous donations from Southampton University, ECS & Engineering companies. The following companies were heavily involved in the 2010 competition sponsorship.
